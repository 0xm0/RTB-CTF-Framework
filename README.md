A lightweight, easy to deploy CTF framework (in Flask) for HackTheBox style machines.

The main purpose of this project is to serve as a scoring engine and CTF manager.

**Want to see it in action?**

   A live demo of the app is available at: <https://rtblivedemo.herokuapp.com/>.

   You can login and mess around as the admin user `admin:admin` (i.e. username:password combinations) or register your own.

## Features

##### For CTF hosters
* A page to show relevant details about the machine such as name, IP, OS, points and difficulty level. 
* Automatic strong password for administrator
* Well implemented controls for administrators providing features such as issuing notifications, database CRUD operations, full fledged logging,
* Simple User Registration/login process, account management, Forgot password functionalities,
* Flag submission (currently 2 flags: user and root),
* Real time scoreboard tracking,
* Easily deployable on Heroku. 

##### For Developers & Contributors
* Flask-blueprints for modularity and clean codebase,
* Flask-admin for Admin views and easy realtime management,
* Flask-SQLAlchemy for SQL models, 
* Flask-login for session handling,
* Flask-wtf for responsive forms,
* Flask-mail for mail service,
* Flask-bcrypt for password hashing and security,

## Build locally

Please see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

## Host Your Own CTF in a minute with Heroku

1. Sign up on [Heroku](heroku.com), if you haven't already and click on the below "Deploy to Heroku" button.

    [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

2. Give your application an awesome name and _optionally_ specify mail environment variables.
    
    > Note: A psuedo-random password for the **admin** user would be created and set in the config variable `ADMIN_PASS`. On Heroku, you can reveal this password from your application's dashboard settings. Same for the Flask application's `SECRET_KEY`.

3. Open your newly deployed application in the browser, you'll be redirected to login as the `admin` user and do so.

4. Finally, you'll want to `/setup` the CTF Settings and,

#### Yay! Now you have a customized instance of the RTB-CTF-Framework live on Heroku. ðŸŽ‰

> Bonus: You can manage the database CRUD operations from admin views GUI; change machine settings, issue notifications to users, etc.
